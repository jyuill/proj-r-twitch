<h2>Exploring Twitch API</h2>

<a href="https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/" >Reference for New Twitch API</href>

Was able to:

<ul>
<li> get setup with client id
<li> make some basic queries for top games list -> but no data :(
<li> get authentication token for more sophisticated queries
</ul>

Was not able to <strong>get detailed game stats</strong>.

<ul>
<li> was able to make query but got response: 'User Has No Access to Any Games'.
<li> not able to find any info on how to get around this. :(
</ul>
